I'm a senior at Carleton College studying statistics. Currently, I'm a researcher in the Hoopfer Lab at Carleton, focusing on methods to analyze fruit fly behavioral syntax.

This past summer, I was a part of the [Engineers for Exploration REU](https://e4e.ucsd.edu/) at UCSD, under the supervision of [Professor Ryan Kastner](https://kastner.ucsd.edu/ryan/) and [Professor Curt Schurgers](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/people/profile/curt-schurgers) where I worked on on techniques for exploring unlabeled bioacoustic audio data, taking advantage of deep vector embeddings and graph representations of relationships in data. I also work on the validation of computer vision methods for fisheries research.

My previous work mostly consists of statistical consulting for social programs. Earlier this year, I consulted for the Community Action Center in Northfield, aiming to explain effects of administrative and governmental policy changes on participation. Last year, I worked for Metis Ricerche as part of a project addressing inefficiencies and inequities in the Italian healthcare system.

In my free time, I play the guitar and have discovered a passion for surfing (thanks San Diego!)
